**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
Throughout this course I have learned the importance of testing code both for functionality and security. This course mainly focused on 
functionality of concepts, but this code has been written to be easily read and maintained.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
The requirements for this project were descriptive and listed all aspects of what the project needed to include.
For future projects, it will be important to listen to a clients needs and keep consistant communication while the project is being developed.

**How do I approach designing software?**
Simply put, find a need for yourself, or from another person, then start asking questions. Follow the software development life cycle using methodologies and watch the 
project come to life.
